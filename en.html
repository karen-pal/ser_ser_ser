<h2> Introducción </h2>
<p id="introducción">

It's Sunday. I opened Bitwig and connected my Push 2. At the same time, I started playing with a new fine-tuning of a machine learning model for image generation (called Luna Diffusion, based on SD1.5). Fine-tuning is the process of taking an artificial neural network and giving it a more specific direction by adding layers at the end of the network. This allows it to "learn" new concepts or reinforce specific ones: lobotomize, indoctrinate, correct a trend, suggest new paths (in order)."

I was generating images, which involved writing more or less short sentences (prompts) and composing small arrangements, around a minute and a half or so. That duration is basically my comfort zone for the sound aspect currently. When I started, it was more like ten seconds. I'm not the type of person who writes long prompts; I prefer to use loaded words, repetitions, incoherences, and see how the model hallucinates.

I knew this model was fine-tuned to create "ethereal" images, so I wanted to see how it handled Leighton. I quickly got bored with the hegemonic nature of the result and ended up thinking about ways to produce the errors I like the most: too many arms, joints bent in ways they shouldn't be, circular symmetries, religious icons.

I enjoy feeling the noise blowing into my ear.

The word doesn't fully form, either there's a lack of signal or there's an excess of information. In communication, the zero has flipped itself around.

<br>
I feel it this way. I break it down in layers, stacking filters and modifiers on top of digital instruments, seeing what emerges.
<br>
<br>
I've also been thinking about what breaks apart and what is assembled among the broken. I mean, I've been doing that this month and about ten years ago. The image I envision is the jungle growing amidst the ruins of the cathedral. I imagine multiple arms moving between my sheets and on top of the experimentation table.
<br>
<br>
I started the assembly based on a study I had done a few months ago on the sonority of Arca in her self-titled album. It goes as follows:

<br>
I removed the instruments that I no longer liked and began breaking the remaining ones by shifting my focus to different parts of the image.

<br>
The chest.
